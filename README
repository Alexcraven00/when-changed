    ~ What is it?
    
      Tired of switching to the shell to test the changes you just made to
      your code? Starting to feel like a mindless drone, manually running
      pdflatex for the 100th time to see how your resume now looks?
      
      Worry not, when-changed is here to help! Whenever it sees that you have
      changed the the file, when-changed runs any command you specify.
      
      So to generate your latex resume automatically, you can do this:
      
      $Â when-changed CV.tex pdflatex CV.tex
      
      Sweetness!
